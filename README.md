# Getting started

## Installation

`npm install -g chic.js`

## Usage

1. Create a new Sveltekit app with `chic new MyApp`
2. Change into your app directory with `cd MyApp`
3. Use the `chic make` command to scaffold views, models, routes & API endpoints for a new resource. For example: `chic make Book title:string author:string about:text`, will create a Book resource with all the views, model and controllers need for CRUD operations on your resource.
4. Run the development server with `chic s`
5. And voila! You have a working app with a Book resource.

## Routes

Chic.js adds a `/routes` endpoint to your app, which shows all the routes in your app - for example API endpoints for your resources created by Chic.js. This is useful for debugging and development. To hide the `/routes` endpoint in production, set `CHIC_DEBUG=OFF` in your `.env` file.
